Build an interactive, multi-player experience that builds on the material we have covered thusfar in the semester. Ideas for this project might include a game, a live-data stream, a multi-user audio experience, an interactive installation...

Focus on the user experience of your project - what will it be like for multiple people to play this game at the same time? Will they connect on their phones? On a computer? What keeps them coming back for more?

*You may work with a partner on this project, but you cannot work with someone that you have already collaborated with. You may also extend an existing assignment, although there must be significant improvements/changes made to it.*

<hr>

**Project proposals due March 6th** - create a blog post with a paragraph description of your concept for the project and any visual references (illustrations, system diagrams, etc.). You should also describe the technical components - *how* do you plan to actually build this thing?


**Project 1 is due in class on Wednesday, March 22nd**
