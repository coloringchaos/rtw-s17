We use *this* similar to the way we use pronouns in natural languages like English and French. We write, “John is running fast because ***he*** is trying to catch the train.” Here is a [helpful writeup](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/) on Javascript's *This*.

All functions in JavaScript have properties, just as objects have properties. And when a function executes, it gets the *this* property—a variable with the **value of the object that invokes the function where this is used**. Here's an example:

	var person = {
		firstName: "John",
		lastName: "Brown",

		// Since the "this" keyword is used inside the 
		// showFullName method below, and the showFullName 
		// method is defined on the person object,
		//"this" will have the value of the person object 
		// because the person object will invoke showFullName()​

		showFullName:function () {
			console.log (this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
		}	
	​
	}
	​
	person.showFullName (); //John Brown

In most cases, the value of this is determined by how a function is called. It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. It is important to understand that in JavaScript, ***this*** is not assigned a value until an object invokes the function where ***this*** is defined.
