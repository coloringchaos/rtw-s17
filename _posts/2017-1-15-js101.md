## Hello JavaScript

<br>

[Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It is a scripting language most often used for client-side web development. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins.

JavaScript runs in a browser that allows pages to be more dynamic and interactive.

### <span class="underlined">Using JavaScript on the Web</span>

Typically JavaScript is written in the HEAD of an HTML document such as follows:

	<html>
		<head>
			<script type="text/javascript"> 
				alert("Hi There!"); 
			</script>
		</head>
		<body>
			Nothing here..
		</body>
	</html>


It can also be a separate file located on a webserver:

	<html>
		<head>
			<script type="text/javascript" src="myscript.js"></script>
		</head>
		<body>
			Nothing here..
		</body>
	</html>
		
or both:

	<html>
		<head>
			<script type="text/javascript" SRC="myscript.js"></script>
			
			<script type="text/javascript"> 
				alert("Hi There!"); 
			</script>
		</head>
		<body>
			Nothing here..
		</body>
	</html>

<br>

### <span class="underlined">Variables</span>

Defined by `var`

	var avariable; // Declares a variable called avariable
	avarable = 15; // Assigns 15 to that variable

Variables are not generally "typed".. You can do this:

	var anothervariable = "My Name Is Arielle";
	alert(anothervariable);
	anothervariable = 15;
	alert(anothervariable);
