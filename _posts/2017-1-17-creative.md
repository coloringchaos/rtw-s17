Each of you has a space on CU's Creative Server where you can post work for this class. We will be primarily utilizing a cloud server, [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), throughout this class, but you should continue to utilize the Creative Server when it makes sense for a particular project. 

<br>

To upload content to the creative server, you must connect to the server via FTP (file transfer protocol). Use either **Fetch** or **Cyberduck** for this. 

Remember that when attempting to upload to the server from off campus, you FIRST need to connect to **CU's Cisco VPN**!!!
