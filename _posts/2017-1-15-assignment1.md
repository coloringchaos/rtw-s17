Create an interactive web-based conceptual self-portrait. 

You should use HTML, CSS and Javascript. Your project should rely on the use of creative media elements (images, video, audio, etc..) and introduce who you are in a unique way. 

Post your self portrait on the Creative Server and submit the link on Edmodo.
