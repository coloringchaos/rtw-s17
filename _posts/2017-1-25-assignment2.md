Create an interactive web-based conceptual self-portrait. 

Work with the [simple chat](/rtw-s17/simple-chat) demo that we went through in class and extend it some how. Work with the styling especially and consider interesting ways that chat content or text data could be displayed or sent back and forth. Perhaps consider other data that could be sent. 

Write a blog post explaining what you made - use videos, screenshots or code snippets where it is appropriate. The idea with this post is that you could return to it in a year and be able to understand what you made. You also must post this code to Github. 

On Edmodo, submit a link to your github and to your blog post.
