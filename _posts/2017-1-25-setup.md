### <span class="underlined">Node.js</span>

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript (ECMAScript) engine for building server side apps. It uses [V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/), Google's open source high-performance JavaScript engine.

Node is **Event/Callback driven** - A callback function is registered for a specific event. When that event occurs the callback method is run.

<br>

### <span class="underlined">A Public Server</span>

In order to run node servers that are accessible to others via the internet, we'll need somewhere to host it. At the moment, the easiest way to run a Node.js server is to use a company such as [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com/) which provides **Virtual Private Servers**. Digital Ocean has a few things going for them, first is the [cost](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/), second is the fact that you can get one running with Node.js already installed very quickly.

In order to get started, you'll need to **create an account** with Digital Ocean.

After that, you can go ahead and create a **"droplet"** - this is Digital Ocean's term for a VPS. 

<span class="underlined">Choose an image:</span>&nbsp; **Ubuntu 16.04.1 x64** 

<span class="underlined">Move to tab â€˜One Click Appsâ€™:</span>&nbsp; choose **Node 4.4.5 on 14.04** - version # might change

<span class="underlined">Size:</span>&nbsp; smallest is good

<span class="underlined">Datacenter region:</span>&nbsp; whatever is closest to you

<span class="underlined">Choose a host name:</span>&nbsp; I used â€˜rtwâ€™

<br>

### <span class="underlined">Connecting to this Digital Ocean server via the Command Line</span>

Digital Ocean will email you a password to use with the default "root" account. In order to do anything, you first have to login to the newly created server via the command line to change your password. 

On a Mac, use Terminal, no windows use Command Prompt. Open the command line app and type the following command (the "ip_address" is in the email you got from Digital Ocean.) 

	ssh root@ip_address
		
You will be prompted to enter the password (which is also from the email) and then prompted to enter it again to change it. Go ahead and change it to something you will remember but sufficiently complex that it will be difficult for hackers.

<i class="fa fa-star-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Anytime you want to connect to your Digital Ocean server, use the `ssh root@ip_address` terminal command and enter the password you just selected. 

<br>

### <span class="underlined">Uploading to the Server</span>

In order to upload to your server, we need to use a tool that will allow us to connect via SSH to transfer the files. Fetch and Cyberduck are good tools for this, I prefer [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en). 

<i class="fa fa-star-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>To connect via SFTP: 

Choose **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol)

<span class="underlined">Server</span> = the IP address emailed to you by Digital Ocean

<span class="underlined">Username</span> = "root"

<span class="underlined">Password</span> = whatever you just created in Terminal

<!-- ### <span class="underlined">Installing Node</span>

[Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing a diverse variety of tools and applications, most notable server side applications. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. 

<br>

***Follow these steps to get Node set up:***

First, open Terminal (osx) or Command Prompt (windows) and check to see whether you already have node installed. Enter this:

	node -v

You will get a response "`command not found`" if you do not have Node. 

ðŸ‘‰ [Download and Install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Return to Terminal or Command Prompt and check again:

	node -v

This time it should respond with the version of Node, something like `v6.9.4`

<br> 

To install the HTTP node server, in the Terminal window on OSX / Linux, enter this:

	sudo npm install -g http-server

In the Command Prompt window on Windows, enter this (you might need to open the command prompt as admin):

	npm install -g http-server

Done! -->
