### <span class="link">Presentation</span>

Prepare a 15 minute presentation of your topic. You should have slides to accompany your talk, but please ***do not fill these with text!*** Your slides should show graphics, perhaps very short videos, or any other visual references to support what you are discussing. Practice your presentation, and **do not read from your slides**!!

We will have time for discussion and questions following your presentation. 

*Presentation is worth 40 pts*

### <span class="link">Writeup and References</span>

Write a ~500 words summary of your research on this topic. You can assume some level of technical knowledge from your audience, but you should discuss and present your topic in a way that is comprehensive and approachable. I encourage you to focus on both the social *and* technical aspects of your topic. You may include supporting graphics or photos if it strengthens your discussion. 

You must include at least 7 credible sources. You can use articles and things found on the internet, but use your discression to choose legitimate references. If you have questions about whether a source is appropriate, check with me. 

Submit your writeup and references as one document - this can be turned in either as a google doc or pdf.

*Writeup and References is worth 40 points*

See the [Schedule](/rtw-s17/schedule) for due dates by group. Writeups and References are due the same day as your presentation.
